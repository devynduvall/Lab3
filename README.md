Project Description: This project is about creating a web-map of the airports within the United States. Each icon represents the location of an airport and the color of that respective icon determines if it has a control tower or not. It also shows a choropleth map of how many airports are in each state. The web-map utilizes Javascript and Leaflet libraries.
